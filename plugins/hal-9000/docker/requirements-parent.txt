# HAL-9000 Parent Container Python Dependencies
#
# All dependencies are pinned to exact versions for supply chain security.
# Do not use >= or ~= operators - specify exact versions only.
#
# To update dependencies:
#   1. Check for security advisories: pip-audit -r requirements-parent.txt
#   2. Update version numbers carefully
#   3. Test in development environment first
#   4. Rebuild parent container image

# Security review: Supply chain security - pin all transitive deps

# ChromaDB server for vector storage
# Provides embedding storage and similarity search for Claude workers
# Release notes: https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/releases
chromadb==0.5.23

# ChromaDB transitive dependencies (pinned for security)
# These prevent dependency confusion attacks on transitive packages
# Run 'pip freeze' after installing chromadb to get exact versions

# Note: For maximum security, use pip-compile from pip-tools to generate
# a fully pinned requirements file with hashes:
#   pip-compile --generate-hashes requirements-parent.in -o requirements-parent.txt
#
# However, this requires the .in file to exist and pip-tools installed.
# Current approach: pin main package, document transitive deps should be audited.
