# Archived Project Management Files

This directory contains historical session records and completed phase documentation that have been archived to keep the active `.pm/` directory clean and focused.

## Contents

### Claudy Implementation Session (2026-01-25)
Historical records from the Claudy Phase 1 implementation work:

- **SESSION-SUMMARY-2026-01-25.md** - Complete session summary including implemented features, testing results, and setup
- **PHASE1-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md** - Detailed status report on claudy core, installation script, documentation, and PM infrastructure
- **PHASE1-WEEK1-SUMMARY.md** - Week 1 completion summary with metrics and code quality assessment

**Note**: Claudy implementation was a separate effort from the main DinD Orchestration Architecture epic (hal-9000-f6t). These files document that work for historical reference.

### Phase 0 Context (2026-01-25)
Historical context document from when the DinD epic was in Phase 0:

- **CONTINUATION-PHASE0.md** - Original CONTINUATION.md documenting Phase 0 completion and Phase 1 readiness (OBSOLETE - epic now fully complete)

## Why Archived

These files were moved to archive because:
1. **Completed work**: Claudy Phase 1 Week 1-2 is complete and not actively being extended
2. **Different scope**: Claudy implementation is separate from the main DinD Orchestration Architecture epic
3. **Cleaner active .pm/**: Keeps the root `.pm/` directory focused on the current project state
4. **Historical reference**: Preserved for future reference and lessons learned

## How to Use

If you need to reference historical decisions or design rationale:

1. Check the original file (e.g., `CONTINUATION-PHASE0.md`) for the specific phase/date
2. Review `SESSION-SUMMARY-2026-01-25.md` for complete session context
3. Check `PHASE1-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` for detailed technical status

## Active Project State

For current project information, see:
- `.pm/PROJECT-CONTINUATION.md` - Current project state and next steps
- `.pm/PROJECT-COMPLETION.md` - Epic completion summary
- `.pm/CONTEXT_PROTOCOL.md` - How agents interact with this project
- `plugins/hal-9000/docs/dind/` - Current DinD documentation
